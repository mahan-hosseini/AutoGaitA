# Annotation Tables

In this folder we provide template and example Annotation Tables for *AutoGaitA_DLC* and *AutoGaitA_Simi*. Users are advised to first watch our **[instruction videos on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCn5T7K_H8K56NIcEsfDK664OP7cN_Bad&si=mV5p2--nYvbofkPh)**, then fill out a template Annotation Table with their time information and use the example Annotation Tables to confirm correct formatting.

## General Recommendations
1. Enter time in seconds with time of videos starting at zero (i.e., the first frame corresponds to 1 / sampling rate (in Hz) seconds) 
2. Please save .xlsx files.
3. Please use numeric columns for time stamps (text columns are not recommended but in theory work if you use dots for decimals (e.g. 2.58)).
4. Please define step-cycles as the start of one swing-phase to the end of the subsequent stance-phase/start of the next swing-phase.
5. If you analyse behaviour other than gait, just use the swing(ti) and stance(te) columns for entering the start and end times of each occurrence of the behaviour of interest.
6. We recommend that you have separate Annotation Tables and data-folders (!) for separate conditions (genotypes, task, age, etc.)

## A helpful tool
Users working with ImageJ/FIJI are encouraged to use the lightweight and open-source [AnnotationTable-Plugin](https://github.com/luca-flemming/AnnotationTable-Plugin) developed by our contributor Luca Flemming. This plugin is easy to set up and simplifies the creation of Annotation Tables drastically by removing the necessity of noting down timestamps by hand.
